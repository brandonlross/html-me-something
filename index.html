        <p class = "text"> I was born in August 19, 1993 in St. Louis, MO.
          I am the oldest of three, one brother (Broderick) and one sister (Brittany).
          My parents are Louis and Sherry Ross.
          I have lived in St. Louis my whole life, more specifically in the North County area.
         We have always had dogs in our house growing up - miniature pinschers & pitbulls. My father also keeps fish in his two fish tanks.</p>

          <p class = "caption"> My early life...hmmm </p>
          <p class = "text"> My early life was very centered around sports which kind of remains true to this day. I attended Grannemann elementary school until 7th grade, when I switched schools
              to Salem Lutheran Elementary for my middle school years. I began basketball at the age of 3 and football at the age of 7 which I continued through college. I played youth football for the
              Florissant Raiders and AAU basketball for the St. Louis Hawks, Xplosion and Majestics.

        <img src = "MacintoshHD\Users\BrandonRoss\Documents\lc101\html-me-something\images\lutherannorth.jpg" id = "pic3" />
        <p class = "text"> Beginning in the fall of 2007 I started attending Lutheran North High School, where I participated in football, basketball and track.
          Overall, I would say that I enjoyed my time in high school. I met a lot of new people and experienced new things. I feel it really prepared me well for the college work. My basketball team
      lost the state championship my freshman year and our football team made the playoffs every year I was there. I was an all-conference linebacker and all-region as well as a senior. My junior year I started
  at quarterback.</p>

        <p class = "caption"> Wild Times in the Chuck </p>
        <p class = "text"> In the fall of 2011 I started at Eastern Illinois University, located in Charleston, IL aka "The Chuck". This was probably the most fun time of my life to this point.
        I met so many different people and had so many memorable experiences. During college, I participated on the football team and won 2 conference championships. I also received the scholar athlete award.
    I became a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity inc. I majored in business management and management information systems. I graduated in December of 2015.</p>
